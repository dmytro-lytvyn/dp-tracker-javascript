# Data Platform: Javascript Events Tracker

This is a very simple (mostly Stackoverflow'ed) script that doesn't use any external libraries and can be added to web pages to track page views (by default), but also other events when necessary. Page's "window.onload" function is extended in the script itself, so nothing has to be done in the HTML code, but to track additional events, sendEvent() function has to be explicitly called with the necessary parameters (see test_page.html file for examples). The events are ingested and processed in real-time by Data Platform.
To provide "origin_id" and "session_id" in the events, the script saves two cookies with UUID values: "DevId" that is set once and never expires, and "SesId" that expires after 30 minutes, but this timeout is being renewed with each event.
